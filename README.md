Digital Image Processing

This project is about image compression using SVD. Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images to perform image analysis and  reducing the cost and time for storage and transmission. But during this process the important features of the image should remain preserved. One such method which serves the purpose is Singular Value Decomposition where images are compressed for different singular values and error between original image and compressed image is calculated.

It performs variuous operations such as,

1. Addition of Images

2. Difference of Images

3. Skeletonization of Images

4. Segmentation using Watershed Algorithm

5. Image Compression Using JPEG Algorithm
